# 100 Days of Code ðŸ’»

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge repository! This space documents my journey through the challenge, including daily updates, reflections, and links to resources and projects. Throughout this challenge, I' aimed to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new technologies, and become a better programmer, one day at a time.

#### 10th March - 18th June 2024

## Day 1: 

Today I practised problem solving and planning by completing Katas on Code Wars. Whilst these challenges continue to strengthen my problem solving and planning skills, what has noticablly improved for me this weekend is that I now use technical terms appropriately and I have a greater understanding of how powerful JavaScript actually is. I have been learning map, splice, split, join and reduce.

## Day 2:

Today I learned about Quality Assurance. I installed Vitest and built test files to test functions. I learned about the three A's (Arrange, Act and Assert) to help structure my tests. I put the 3 A's into practice and learned how to throw errors! Additionally, it was great to learn real-world examples of why testing is so important (the Horizon Scandal) and their human cost.

## Day 3:

Today myself and my team at School of Code continued to learn about quality assurance and was introduced to Test Driven Development. We created a test to fail, then created functions to pass the test and finally refactored our code. We also explored the Eisenhower Matrix to discuss how to prioritse actions and tasks and finished the day with an insightful talk on QA from the co-founders of Loupe Testware, James Fairclough and Linford Copeland.

## Day 4:

Today I had a talk from Nadeem Shabir and Darren Arbon from Technology from Sage who shared their experiences of quality assurance and Test Driven Development. In the afternoon I learned how to use Vitest and Supertest to test API route handlers and helper functions. I took extra time to learn how to write the tests myself which helped with consolidating our knowledge.
The highlight of my day was watching my team mates eyes brighten and laughter break out when we were impressed with how effortless Playwright's extensions helped formulate the tests. Everyday I'm amazed with how powerful the software is and I'm excited to continue learning its capabilities.

## Day 5: 

Today I began planning my project, which was to create a Codewars-inspired kata. This was intended to put my quality assurance and testing skills into practice. I'm happy with my level of planning and creating tables for Equivalency Partitioning, Identifying Boundary Values, Designing Test Cases, and Decision Tables.

## Day 6:

Today I continued with my project by building my tests and functions. I was able to create working tests and functions, and I'm happy with my final product. Next time, I would keep my kata story and testing simple and, if I had more time, add error statuses.

## Day 7: 

Today I refreshed my knowledge on JavaScript fundamentals. The more I consolidate my knowledge and understand each component's function and purpose, the easier it will be to write code and build my knowledge base. I spent time on Exercism and Codecademy and completed a few more katas on Codewars. My favorite kata of the day was created by my peer Timothy Bridge. It was creative and fun to complete, and reminded me to pay attention to detail. Initially, I only included the summation of Chris' flies, but I had to do this for Tom's and Cat's too!

## Day 8: 

Today I refreshed my skills on semantic HTML, CSS Grid, and Flexbox. As an audio and practical learner, having articles read aloud and playing games that practiced Grid and Flexbox was really helpful. These topics felt more familiar to me than recent back-end and JavaScript topics, as a HTML/CSS challenge of recreating the Airbnb website was a pre-course challenge for School of Code.

## Day 9:

Today I expanded my knowledge by learning about media queries and mobile-first design, and was able to recreate a site ensuring that it was device responsive. I feel more comfortable with front-end tasks. Understanding the steps needed to make websites work is starting to piece it all together for me.

## Day 10: 

Today we continued with a School of Code workshop where I learned about React and put it into practice. My team created new files to store different components and CSS, learned how to use props with arrays, and explored why using IDs is important. We're close to finishing the CSS changes for desktop. I'll proudly show our site tomorrow, as we noticed our energy dipping and decided to take a break and return tomorrow.

## Day 11: 

Today I began using NextJS and learned about pages and layouts. Having lots of files can get quite complicated quickly, but having everything in separate components is overall better for reusability.

##### Link to work: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc16-w7d2-workshop-vitereact-boilerplate-week7-room15.git

## Day 12: 

Today I learned about state, useEffect, and useState, and implemented them into my FirePlace Palace project by introducing buttons and a menu. I struggle with linking these concepts together, so I need to plan more in-depth and practice to become more familiar.

##### Link to work: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc16-w7d2-workshop-vitereact-boilerplate-week7-room15.git

## Day 13: 

Today I continued learning about state, useEffect, and useState, and implemented a review section into my FirePlace Palace project. While it was tough at times, the sense of achievement from finishing the project with my team made it all worthwhile. We presented this to our peers and it went really well.

##### Link to work: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc16-w7d2-workshop-vitereact-boilerplate-week7-room15.git

## Day 14:

Today I consolidated my knowledge and understanding of React by using the React Visualized resource. As a visual learner, this helped me a lot. I was able to see state, rendering, and other aspects clearly.

## Day 15: 

Today to cement my knowledge of React, I used various resources: Codecademy for lessons and exercises, many YouTube videos, and I reviewed the workshops from last week. I created a list of things I felt most confident with to help direct my weekly studies. I feel ready to begin a personal project to integrate the new concepts I learn every week.

## Day 16:

Today I continued to cement my knowledge of React by creating a React flashcard website with my group. I was introduced to forms and passing functions as props. Forms are such common features on websites, so it felt good to learn about them and gain more skills and experience for my personal project.

##### Link to work: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc16-w8d1-workshop-react-flashcards-week7-room15

## Day 17:

Today my team and I continued with our FirePlace Palace workshop, working with forms and learning about error messages and validation. This has been the week I've enjoyed the most at SoC, and I am feeling very engaged and motivated.

## Day 18: 

Today we continued the Fireplace Palace project and had a guest speaker at School of Code who spoke about their experience on a previous bootcamp and their experiences after the course. Our guest speaker gave a realistic and engaging talk, which was both inspiring and motivating.

##### Link to work: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/bc16-w7d3-workshop-nextjs-boilerplate-week7-room15

## Day 19: 

Today we started a hackathon project where we refactored our useState in the Fireplace Palace project to useReducer. useReducer was difficult to grasp at first, but it was great to learn how to use it and understand its benefits.

## Day 20: 

This weekend, I began an e-commerce website project. I was overly excited to start, but I refocused and ensured that I planned well. I made a component tree to visualize each component and file, and found a website from a photographer I admire, using GoFullPage to break down their website into sections. As I began creating, I learned how to use CSS modules and why it's important to optimize images. I initially forgot to start with a mobile-first approach when breaking the site down on GoFullPage, so I adapted my plan to create a great mobile website first and then the desktop version. Film photography is a passion of mine, and this project will showcase and sell my photos. I've found myself becoming addicted to this project and feel proud to incorporate the photos I've taken ðŸ“¸.

## Day 21: 30th March 2024

Today I continued with my e-commerce project and started using GitHub Projects to help keep track of planning and my todos. I feel like I'm learning a lot. For everything I try to implement, I then learn about many different things while building.

## Day 22:

Today my team and I continued our hackathon project to learn about the concepts we didn't complete during the hackathon. Afterward, I spent some time exploring other gaps in my knowledge and working my way up from the fundamentals. I know that the better understanding I have of the fundamentals, the better my knowledge will be with other aspects, so I need to keep going.

## Day 23: 1st April 2024

Today I learned about user authentication and how to use local storage in my project. I implemented a login feature and created a user context. This was a bit challenging, but it was satisfying to see the login feature working. I look forward to adding more features like user roles and permissions.

## Day 24:

UX/UI week has begun at the School of Code! We started off the day reflecting on last week and delivering face2face peer feedback before having an insightful talk from Olivia Winteringham who shared so many helpful resources and great insights. Then we delved deeper into agile and product led teams and discussed questions which would help us identify these teams when interacting with companies.

## Day 25: 

To continue UX/UI week we learned about the 5 stages of Design Thinking: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test. To explore empathise and define we learned a range of different qualitative and quantitative research methods that we can use to understand a problem and our users.

We were able to create two personas that represented our user's from different perspectives. We then explored the ideate and prototype stages as the research and personas will lead us to a solution that is multi-faceted and will work for both cases.

From this, our team learned that not all problems are what you originally hypothesise. It's so important to listen to user's needs, problems and opinions and to keep their say at the forefront of product design.

## Day 26: 

Now we've passed through the Empathize, Define, and Ideate phases of the Design Thinking framework, today we started on Prototype. We began by taking our research findings and new problem statement and used Disney Ideation to start exploring ideas for a solution.

After finalizing a solution, we learned how to use Figma to convert our solution into a low-fidelity framework. I really enjoyed seeing our solution come to life by creating the framework and learning about how useful a tool Figma is. We also kept in mind important tips like contrast and balance to create an appealing design.

I took some time to familiarize myself with Figma even more and used the new things I learned today on my e-commerce project. For example, I used the Colour Contrast site, which explained that my font and background did not pass accessibility tests, and therefore I changed my font to black to accommodate this!

## Day 27: 

Yesterday, we ended the product design week with a Researchathon. The goal was to learn how to explore a new topic and how to clearly share that learning with others in a presentation. My wonderful team, Nada Shetty and Chari Cruz, and I chose to explore the component library Material UI. It was great to do our own research and share our knowledge, and the challenge of recording ourselves definitely pushed me outside of my comfort zone.

I really struggled with time management and delegation this week and feel like our final product was not as polished as I would have liked it to be. However, what I am really proud of is that weeks ago, I would have been very disappointed with myself, and self-doubt would have crept in. But my mindset has completely shifted over the last three weeks, and now I feel glad that I did it and have taken away a lot of knowledge, tips, and reflections to better equip me for next time.

## Day 28:

Today, Timothy and I planned to meet up for some component practice, and it turned into much more than that. It was like a mini-agile session where I showed him the very early stages of my e-commerce site. The feedback and tips that Timothy provided me really helped improve the quality of my project, and I can't thank him enough!

We started the process of looking into Atomic design, which focuses on designing systems of components. This involves breaking down a page into reusable components. For my e-commerce site, this involved creating a logo component that uses props to pass data between the parent element and the child element so I could reuse my logo on different pages but still be able to have a unique width depending on the page. Finally, we used flexbox to allow for a responsive welcome page, and Timothy taught me some great tips on SVGs.

## Day 29: 

Today I spent the day recapping manipulating the DOM by watching Web Dev Simplified on YouTube and going through the School Of Code learning material. Previous bootcampers have mentioned that things don't start to click till week 8/9 and its so true. I definitely feel in a place of familiarity with concepts now which makes recapping flow more easily and I am able to learn the things that felt like too much information many weeks ago.

## Day 30: 

Today has been the start of DevOps week at School Of Code! I began by only knowing a simple definition but with great explanations from the coaches it eased us into the concept very well! We then spent the day researching, installing and exploring Sentry (sentry.io) and I was impressed by it's capabilities and tools.

This afternoon, myself and Timothy Bridge explored the basics of TypeScript and learned how to declare and intialise variables, implement functions, declare a new type that describes an object and declare a new type alias!
